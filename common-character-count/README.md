Common Character Count
-----

Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

##### Example

For `string1 = "aabcc"` and `string2 = "adcaa"`, <br>the output should be `commonCharacterCount(string1, string2) = 3`.

Both strings have three common characters: `a` occurs twice and `c` occurs once.
